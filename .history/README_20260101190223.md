## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash

# Start development server
bun run dev

**Grilled Inc — Dispatch (Driver & Manager apps)**

This repository contains a real-time delivery dispatch application with two main frontends:

- A Manager dashboard for creating and assigning orders, monitoring fleet status, and viewing analytics.
- A Driver app that shows assigned deliveries on a map, provides routing/ETA, and supports in-app issue reporting and notification sounds.

Key features
- Real-time order and location updates (WebSocket/mini-services). 
- Map rendering with MapLibre GL and client-side route fetching using OSRM.
- Notification sounds and browser notifications for drivers (audio assets in `public/sounds`).
- Driver UI includes a route map component that fetches routes and reports `onRouteStatus('loading'|'ready'|'fallback')`.
- Prisma for database access and server APIs for orders/drivers/metrics.

Getting started (development)
1. Install dependencies:

	npm install

2. Run the dev server:

	npm run dev

3. Open the apps in your browser:

	- Manager: http://localhost:3000/ (dashboard)
	- Driver: http://localhost:3000/driver

Notes
- Some browsers block autoplay of audio; interacting with the page (click/tap) may be required to hear notification sounds.
- Map chunks are loaded dynamically; the app includes a client-side recovery path for chunk load errors.

Project layout (top-level)

```
public/                 # static assets (sounds, images)
src/
  app/                  # Next.js app routes (manager & driver pages)
  components/           # React components (driver-route-map, UI, etc.)
  lib/                  # client helpers (notifications, maplibre loader)
  hooks/                # custom hooks
prisma/                  # Prisma schema and seed
mini-services/           # small bundled services (location-service, etc.)
```

How to test notification sounds
1. Hard-refresh the Driver page: `http://localhost:3000/driver?cachebust=TIMESTAMP`.
2. Click anywhere in the page to enable audio if it's blocked.
3. Trigger a notification (e.g., via assigning an order) — the driver app uses `/public/sounds/notification-alert.wav` and a decline tone for declined orders.

Contributing
- Open an issue or pull request for bugs or feature requests.
- Keep UI and accessibility in mind when changing driver/manager flows.

License
- See the repository root for license information (if present).

If you'd like, I can also normalize the sound filenames in `public/sounds` (remove spaces) and update the code references accordingly.
